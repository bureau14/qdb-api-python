/**
 * QuasarDB's logging handler works with callbacks, and unfortunately is fairly
 * error prone to 'just keep exactly one callback': if there are no active
 * sessions left, the callback is removed.
 *
 * As such, the only way to bridge this logging API with QuasarDB's is to:
 *
 *  - frequently (i.e. every new connection) remove any existing callbacks and
 *    set our new callback.
 *
 *  - when a callback is invoked, keep a local container with buffered logs.
 *
 *  - from all other functions, basically after every native qdb call, flush all
 *    buffered logs.
 *
 *  - unfortunately, QuasarDB also buffers the logs before triggering callbacks,
 *    so it is unlikely that relevant logs are already present here right after an
 *    error. :'(
