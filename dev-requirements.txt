# Numpy / Pandas are difficult to build in various environments (especially
# FreeBSD), and there are some conflicting requirements. For example, Numpy
# doesn't have any version that works on both Python 3.6 and Python 3.10.

numpy ~= 1.19.5; python_version <= '3.7'
numpy ~= 1.20.3; python_version == '3.8'
numpy ~= 1.20.3; python_version == '3.9'
numpy ~= 2.0.1;  python_version > '3.9'

pandas ~= 2.0.3; python_version == '3.9'
pandas ~= 2.0.3; python_version == '3.8'
pandas ~= 1.3.5; python_version == '3.7'
pandas ~= 1.1.5; python_version <= '3.6'

# Need 2.1.2 for numpy 2.0 support
pandas >= 2.1.2; python_version > '3.9'
