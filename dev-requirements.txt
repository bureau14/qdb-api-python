## Non-FreeBSD
#
# Numpy / Pandas are difficult to build in various environments (especially
# FreeBSD), and there are some conflicting requirements. For example, Numpy
# doesn't have any version that works on both Python 3.6 and Python 3.10.

numpy == 1.19.5; python_version <= '3.9' and sys_platform != "freebsd13"
pandas >= 1.0.0; python_version <= '3.9' and sys_platform != "freebsd13"
numpy == 1.21.2; python_version > '3.9' and sys_platform != "freebsd13"
pandas == 1.3.4; python_version > '3.9' and sys_platform != "freebsd13"

wheel == 0.37.0; sys_platform != "freebsd13"
pytest == 6.2.5; sys_platform != "freebsd13"
pytest-runner == 5.3.1; sys_platform != "freebsd13"
pytest-benchmark == 3.4.1; sys_platform != "freebsd13"

## FreeBSD
#
# For FreeBSD, it is a difficult challenge to find an "equilibrium" of package
# versions that work well together. For this reason, we defer to the OS-maintained
# packages whenever we can; all packages below are, in fact, installed using
# ports (e.g. `pkg install py38-numpy py38-pandas py38-pytest` etc)

numpy; sys_platform == "freebsd13"
pandas; sys_platform == "freebsd13"

wheel; sys_platform == "freebsd13"
pytest; sys_platform == "freebsd13"
pytest-runner; sys_platform == "freebsd13"
pytest-benchmark; sys_platform == "freebsd13"


## Any environment
